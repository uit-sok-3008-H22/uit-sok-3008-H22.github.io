|*Preparation*  | | In this course, we base our estimation using an open-source programming software R with a graphical user interface RStudio.Therefore, you are encourgaed to donwload them on your laptop and familiarize yourself. You can download R at [R](http://www.r-project.org){:target='_blank_'}, and R-Studio at [R-Studio](http://www.rstudio.com){:target='_blank_'}. If you have got any problems downloading R and RStudio, contact "Orakelet". You can also use the online version of R using jupyter interfce at [jupyter](https://www.jupyter.uit.no){:target='_blank_'}.  <br />                                                                                                                                                                                                <br />                                                                                                                                                              If you need to improve your R skills, have a look at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r){:target='_blank_'} for free. Follow this link for a bunch of [CheatSheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/){:target='_blank_'}. Note the RStudio IDE Cheat sheet and the Data Transformation Cheat sheet. For most of the chapters in the course, our textbook will be: [Principles of Econometrics](http://principlesofeconometrics.com/poe5/poe5.html){:target='_blank_'}, 5th Edition (POE5), Wiley - 2018. Available at the campus bookstore Akademika. So, you are encouraged to buy the book. |                                                   <br />
